## ‚ú® What is AIOPicks?

AIOPicks is a FastAPI-powered Stremio addon that turns your Trakt watch history into AI-curated, ever-changing
catalogs. Every refresh uses the Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite model on OpenRouter to craft brand-new themes, names, and
recommendations so you never scroll the same rows twice.

Because everything runs on your own server, your data never leaves your control. Connect your Trakt account, provide an
OpenRouter API key, and enjoy endlessly fresh discovery playlists.

## üöÄ Key Features

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Personalization
- **Trakt Integration**: Pulls your watch history (movies & series) with extended metadata
- **OpenRouter AI**: Uses `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` for imaginative yet grounded catalog ideas
- **Randomized Catalogs**: Each refresh injects a random seed so names and picks are always surprising
- **Privacy-Focused**: All history processing and AI prompts happen on your self-hosted instance

### üìä User-Configurable Dynamic Catalogs
AIOPicks invents themed rows with bespoke names and contents:

- **üåô Midnight Mystery Flights** ‚Äì *Atmospheric thrillers for after dark*
- **üé≠ Seoulful Stories** ‚Äì *Emotional Korean dramas aligned with your taste*
- **üî• Weekend Questline** ‚Äì *Series primed for marathon sessions*
- **‚ú® Critics' Curveballs** ‚Äì *Awarded picks you somehow missed*

### üß∞ Flexible Configuration
- **Catalog Count**: Choose how many movie/series rows to generate (1-12)
- **Refresh Interval**: Control how often the AI regenerates catalogs
- **Caching**: Lightweight in-memory cache keeps Stremio responses snappy between refreshes
- **Fallbacks**: If the AI call fails, the addon gracefully falls back to history-based mixes

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- A Trakt account with viewing history (OAuth device authentication recommended)
- OpenRouter API key with access to `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
- (Optional) Docker if you prefer container deployment

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file (or copy `.env.sample`) with your credentials:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key
OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite
TRAKT_CLIENT_ID=your-trakt-client-id
TRAKT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-trakt-access-token
CATALOG_COUNT=6
REFRESH_INTERVAL=43200  # seconds
CACHE_TTL=1800          # seconds
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can obtain a Trakt access token by creating a personal application and using the device code flow. Store the
> long-lived access token for this addon.

## üì• Installation

### Option 1: Docker Compose (recommended)

1. Copy the provided sample configuration: `cp .env.sample .env` and fill in your keys.
2. Start the service with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   The bundled `docker-compose.yml` builds the image, maps port `3000`, loads variables from `.env`, and enables
   automatic restart.

3. Open `http://localhost:3000/manifest.json` and add that URL to Stremio.
4. To update the addon after pulling new code, run `docker compose up -d --build`.

### Option 2: Python environment

If you prefer to run the service directly on your host machine, install the dependencies and launch FastAPI manually:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
cp .env.sample .env  # then edit with your keys
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 3000
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/manifest.json` to confirm the addon is running. Install the manifest URL in Stremio to see
the AI-generated catalogs.

## üß™ Local Development

Use the Python environment instructions above while developing locally. Run the FastAPI server with `uvicorn` in reload
mode and iterate on the addon code. Environment variables are loaded from `.env` on startup.

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- **FastAPI Server** (`app/main.py`): Implements Stremio manifest, catalog, and meta endpoints
- **Catalog Service** (`app/services/catalog_generator.py`): Orchestrates Trakt ingestion, AI prompting, caching, and
  background refresh
- **Trakt Client** (`app/services/trakt.py`): Fetches and summarizes history with optional fallbacks
- **OpenRouter Client** (`app/services/openrouter.py`): Calls Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite with structured prompts and parses
  the JSON response
- **Pydantic Models** (`app/models.py`): Validates AI output and converts it into Stremio-friendly payloads

The service keeps a short-lived cache of the last generated catalogs. A background coroutine refreshes them on the
interval you configure. If OpenRouter is unavailable, it falls back to simple mixes derived from your watch history.

## üì¶ API Surface

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/manifest.json` | Advertises AI-generated catalogs and metadata to Stremio |
| `/catalog/{type}/{id}.json` | Returns the metas array for a specific catalog |
| `/meta/{type}/{id}.json` | Provides metadata for a specific entry |
| `/healthz` | Lightweight readiness probe |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

AIOPicks is a discovery tool. It does not host or stream content‚Äîonly suggests what to watch next based on your own
history. Always access content through legal providers and comply with applicable laws.
